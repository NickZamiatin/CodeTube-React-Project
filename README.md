# Frontend  React Project CodeTube
CodeTube is an app where the user can find four favorite topics in web devlopment. The main idea works with youtube APIs.  This project allowed me to explore how to use YouTube APIs in a react app.

You can filter by AWS, React, JavaScript or Coding Garden. The search results will appear on the next page as a card and then you can click a result to see the video inside an iMac.
